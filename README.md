# BS-BOF
**With this script you can perform the first connection step (fuzzing) against a server to successfully exploit a Buffer OverFlow.**

# In bs-bof.py:
You only need python 2.7 on your machine and correctly configure the IP address and the port (look for the fields called change me).

# In bs-bof2.py:
You only need python on your machine and correctly configure the IP address and the port and create a pattern with the necessary characters. In this case it is 100, but you must modify it with the value you need (look for the fields called change me).

# The way to execute this scripts is simple:

python bs-bof.py 
or 
python bs-bof2.py
